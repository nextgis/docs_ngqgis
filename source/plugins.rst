=================

QGIS was developed with capacity to embed various plugins, which allow to add numerous functions into application. QGIS provides libraries available for plugin creation.
The majority of QGIS functions are implemented as basic or external plugins. 
Basic plugins are written in C++ and Python.
All external plugins are written in Python now. They are located in external repositories and supported by their authors. External plugins can be added via Install Plugins option.
